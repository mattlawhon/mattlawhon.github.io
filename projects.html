      This was my first javascript design. Using the p5.js library, this design
      switches the traditional channel for reading a clock, the angles of the clock 
      hands, to the radii of the three circles representing hour, minute and second. 
      Concentric circles mark every hour and every five minutes and seconds to
      facilitate quick reading.

      <div class="projectText">
      A Katabatic wind is a gravity driven wind. These are the dominant surface wind on 
      Anarctica outside of the summer months, and are resposible for many features of interest to
      climate scientists like wind-scoured blue ice formations, polynya, overturning ocean 
      circulation, and local-scale variations in ice accumulation rates. Katabatic 
      winds are quite volatile, often picking up 40+ mph in the span of minutes and reaching 
      speeds of almost 200 mph in some cases. Unsurprisingly, they are difficult to predict
      and insufficiently accounted for in most climate models. The purpose of this project was
      to investigate the extent to which machine learning and data visualization methods could be 
      applied to better understand the insufficiencies of climate models to accounting for katabatic
      winds. </div>


      <div class = "projectSubTitle">Abstract</div>
      <div class="projectText">
      Katabatic wind patterns are controlled by temperature and pressure gradients and 
      have high diurnal and seasonal variability. In this project, data from 11 Automatic 
      Weather Stations (AWS) and optimally structured neural networks were used to explore 
      the accuracy of near-surface wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range 
      Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), a dataset with many biases. Using the controlling 
      mechanisms of the Katabatic winds as inputs, optimally structured neural networks 
      were trained and used to fill in the sizable data gaps in the AWS wind speed 
      measurements. Our results show from 1985 to 2018 the ECMWF wind speed correlates 
      to the uncleaned AWS wind speed data with r = 0.61, to the cleaned AWS wind speed 
      data with r = 0.74, and to the cleaned and neural network filled-in AWS wind speed 
      data with r = 0.69. These preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy of reducing 
      biases in climate datasets with artificial neural. This is particularly relevant to
      to the many regional climate models that use ECMWF as boundary conditions.

      <div class="projectText">
      At Marilyn station, close to the Transantarctic range and subject to violent katabatic 
      winds, the ECMWF predicts the overall shape of prevalent windspeed inadequately, missing 
      numerous peaks, and predicting peaks 10-15Â° off their actual direction. Further, it is 
      clear that these inaccuracies are most prevelent in the Antarctic winter, when high speed 
      katabatic winds form.

      These graphs capture a sample of the results of our artificial neural network approach. 
      Top is the graph of windspeed values at Margaret between 2008-2011, as they are 
      in the raw data. Bottom is the graph of windspeed values at Margaret between 
      2008-2011, after the data gaps have been filled in using our artificial network. 
      As best seen from the continuity of the line tracking difference between AWS and ECMWF,
      in the bottom plot we filled in the numerous gaps in our data, and have a much better
      picture of the wind speed than in the top plot. This graph is designed to highlight 
      the seasonal pattern in the difference of the AWS and the ECMWF. Outside of the summer
      months, the ECMWF consistently overestimates windspeed at Margaret AWS station.

      <div class = "projectSubTitle">Final Results</div>
      <img class="projectIm" src="bin/ANN Antarctica/Map.png" width="700"/>
      <div class="projectText">
      This map captures the overall accuracy of the ECMWF on the Ross Ice Shelf. In 
      regions near the Transantarctic Mountain Range, the accuracy of wind speed prediction 
      is lowest, with the ECMWF predicting actual windspeed at correlation coefficients 
      nearing 0.5. This is largely due to the presence of intense Katabic winds in this region.
      This models accuracy improves going to the middle of the region. Towards the 
      coast and McMurdo station, the accuracy of wind speed prediction is highest, with the 
      ECMWF predicting actual windspeed at correlation coefficients nearing 0.8.
